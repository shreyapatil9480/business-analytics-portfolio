# Business Analytics Portfolio Project

This repository contains a **synthetic dataset** and a **Jupyter notebook** that showcase skills relevant to roles such as **Business Analyst**, **Program Manager**, and **Data Analyst**.  The project walks through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling using a fictional portfolio of projects.

## Contents

- `synthetic_project_data.csv` – a CSV file containing the synthetic project data.
- `analysis.ipynb` – a Jupyter notebook that loads the dataset, performs EDA, visualizes key patterns, and builds predictive models.
- `requirements.txt` – a list of Python dependencies needed to run the notebook.

## Dataset Description

The dataset represents 250 projects with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **ProjectID** | Unique identifier for each project (e.g. `P001`). |
| **StartDate** | Date when the project started. |
| **PlannedDurationDays** | The planned duration of the project in days. |
| **EndDate** | The planned end date based on the start date and planned duration. |
| **ActualDurationDays** | The actual duration in days (may deviate from the plan). |
| **ActualEndDate** | The actual end date. |
| **Budget** | The planned budget for the project (in arbitrary units). |
| **ActualCost** | The actual cost incurred (may be over/under the budget). |
| **TeamSize** | Number of people assigned to the project. |
| **Complexity** | A categorical variable indicating the complexity level (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`). |
| **Risk** | A categorical variable indicating the risk level (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`). |
| **Status** | The current status of the project (`Completed`, `In Progress`, `Cancelled`). |
| **ScheduleVarianceDays** | Difference between the actual and planned durations (positive means delayed). |
| **CostVariance** | Difference between actual cost and budget (positive means over budget). |
| **Success** | Binary indicator where **1** denotes a successful project (completed on time and under budget) and **0** otherwise. |

All data are **synthetic** and were generated for demonstration purposes only.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to reproduce the analysis on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download it as a ZIP).
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook** and open `analysis.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or, if using JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

5. **Run the notebook** cell by cell to see the analysis, visualizations and models.

## Project Overview

The **analysis notebook** demonstrates:

- **Loading and inspecting the dataset** – overview of data types, summary statistics, and missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualization of distributions (e.g., planned vs. actual durations, budgets), counts by complexity level, cost variance across risk levels, and correlation analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - **Logistic regression** to predict project success using project attributes (duration, cost, complexity, risk, variances, etc.).
  - **Random forest regression** to predict actual project cost as an example of regression modeling.
- **Evaluation metrics** – accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix for classification; mean absolute error (MAE) and R² score for regression.

## Ideas for Extension

You can extend this project to showcase additional skills:

- **Feature engineering** – derive new variables, such as cost performance indices or team productivity metrics.
- **Advanced algorithms** – try decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, XGBoost, or neural networks for classification/regression tasks.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** – use techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model parameters.
- **Time-series analysis** – examine how project metrics change over time or across calendar years.
- **Dashboarding** – build dashboards with tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash to present project insights interactively.
- **SQL integration** – simulate retrieving data from databases and performing SQL-based analysis.
